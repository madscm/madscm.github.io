Madison Cohen-McFarlane received the B.Eng. degree in biomedical engineering from the University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada, in 2015 and the M.A.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering from Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada in 2017. She is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in biomedical engineering at Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada, in the systems and computer engineering department.

She is developing a system to monitor and track non-speech related vocal sound. The system would be applicable to a variety of respiratory health conditions, including COVID-19, that are prevalent in the older adult population, with the goal of improving quality of life and allowing individuals to safely stay in their homes.
